## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Simple Local Server
```bash
# Navigate to the figma-showcase directory
cd figma-showcase

# Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve .

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Option 2: Live Server (VS Code)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html` or `advanced-demo.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Demo (index.html)
1. **Loading Animation**: 
   - Click "Start Animation" to see the 7-step morphing sequence
   - Use the slider to manually control animation steps
   - Adjust timing with Start/Stop/Reset controls

2. **Shape Morphing**:
   - Select different target shapes (Star, Heart, Circle, Square)
   - Use the morph slider to control transition progress
   - Watch real-time morphing between shapes

### Advanced Demo (advanced-demo.html)
1. **Interactive Morphing**:
   - Create polygons with different vertex counts (3-8 sides)
   - Generate star shapes and random polygons
   - Control corner rounding with the rounding slider
   - Enable automatic animation with the Animate button

2. **Loading Animation**:
   - Full control over the 7-step loading sequence
   - Adjustable animation speed (0.1x to 3.0x)
   - Performance monitoring with FPS counter
   - Step-by-step manual control

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Real-time curve and vertex counting
   - Render time measurement
   - Morph calculation timing
   - Frame rate monitoring

## üîß Technical Details

### Morphing Algorithm
The morphing system uses Google's sophisticated curve matching algorithm:

1. **Feature Detection**: Identifies corners and edges in both shapes
2. **Proximity Mapping**: Maps features between shapes based on similarity
3. **Curve Cutting**: Splits curves to align start and end shapes optimally
4. **Interpolation**: Uses cubic B√©zier interpolation for smooth transitions

### Key Classes
- `Morph`: Main morphing engine that handles shape-to-shape transitions
- `RoundedPolygon`: Creates polygons with configurable corner rounding
- `MeasuredPolygon`: Measures polygon features for morphing analysis
- `Cubic`: Handles cubic B√©zier curve mathematics
- `FeatureMapper`: Maps corresponding features between different shapes

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient curve reuse with `MutableCubic` for animation loops
- Hardware-accelerated canvas rendering
- Optimized polygon cutting algorithms
- Real-time bounds calculation for viewport optimization

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Shapes
To add custom shapes, create new `RoundedPolygon` instances:

```javascript
// Create a custom polygon
const vertices = [
    new Point(0, -1),
    new Point(1, 0),
    new Point(0, 1),
    new Point(-1, 0)
];
const customShape = new RoundedPolygon(vertices, cornerRounding);
```

### Styling
Both demo pages use CSS custom properties for easy theming:
- Modify color schemes in the CSS `:root` section
- Adjust animation timings and easing functions
- Customize canvas sizes and layouts

## üì± Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 88+
- **Required Features**: ES6 modules, Canvas 2D API, CSS Grid
- **Recommended**: Hardware acceleration enabled for optimal performance
