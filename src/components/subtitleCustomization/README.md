# Subtitle Customization Components

This directory contains the modularized subtitle customization components that were extracted from the original monolithic `SubtitleCustomizationPanel.js` file.

## Component Structure

### Main Component
- **`SubtitleCustomizationPanel.js`** - Main container component that orchestrates all sub-components

### Sub-Components
- **`PresetButtons.js`** - Handles all preset style buttons (30+ presets including default, modern, classic, neon, gaming, cyberpunk, etc.)
- **`TextControls.js`** - Text-related controls (font family, size, weight, color, alignment, line height, letter spacing, text transform)
- **`BackgroundControls.js`** - Background and border controls (background color/opacity, border radius/width/color/style)
- **`EffectsControls.js`** - Visual effects (text shadow, glow, gradient text, stroke effects)
- **`PositionControls.js`** - Positioning and layout (position, margins, max width)
- **`AnimationControls.js`** - Animation settings (animation type, easing, fade in/out duration)

### Existing Components (Unchanged)
- **`FontSelectionModal.js`** - Modal for font selection with search and categorization
- **`fontOptions.js`** - Font definitions and utility functions

## Benefits of Modularization

1. **Better Code Organization** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Easier Maintenance** - Changes to specific functionality are isolated
3. **Improved Readability** - Smaller, focused components are easier to understand
4. **Reusability** - Individual components can be reused in other contexts
5. **Better Testing** - Each component can be tested independently

## Component Interface

All sub-components follow the same interface pattern:
```javascript
const Component = ({ customization, onChange }) => {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

- `customization` - Current subtitle customization state
- `onChange` - Function to update customization state

## Usage

The main component maintains the same interface as before:

```javascript
import SubtitleCustomizationPanel from './SubtitleCustomizationPanel';

<SubtitleCustomizationPanel
  customization={subtitleCustomization}
  onChange={setSubtitleCustomization}
/>
```

## File Size Reduction

- **Original file**: ~1,726 lines
- **Main component**: ~112 lines
- **Total modular components**: ~1,200+ lines across 6 focused files

This represents a significant improvement in code organization while maintaining all functionality.

## Bug Fixes

### Text Stroke Carryover Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: When switching between presets, text stroke settings were carrying over from presets that had `strokeEnabled: true` to presets that should have `strokeEnabled: false`.

**Root Cause**: Some presets were using `...defaultCustomization` spread operator but not explicitly setting `strokeEnabled: false`, causing the previous state to persist.

**Solution**: Added explicit `strokeEnabled: false` to all presets that should not have text stroke:
- vintage, horror, luxury, kawaii, corporate, vaporwave, steampunk, noir, pastel, glitch, royal, sunset, ocean, forest

**Presets with Stroke Enabled** (intentional):
- gaming, elegant, comic, grunge, anime, bold, sketch

This ensures clean preset switching without unwanted effect carryover.
